## Usage notes

This repository is one package in a multi-package workspace. Keep versioned implementation under `src/vN/` and expose the current version through `src/index.js`. Install the declared dependencies before running the package. The packages are separate repositories in the intended publishing model; placing them together in this ZIP does not publish them to npm or create GitHub repositories.
